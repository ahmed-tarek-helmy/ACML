## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist` folder with all static files ready for deployment.

## Deployment to Shared Hosting (InterServer)

### Step 1: Build the Project
```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Upload Files
1. Connect to your InterServer hosting via FTP (FileZilla, Cyberduck, or cPanel File Manager)
2. Navigate to your public_html directory (or your domain's root directory)
3. Upload ALL contents from the `dist` folder to your hosting
   - Upload: `index.html`
   - Upload: `assets` folder (contains CSS and JS files)
   - Upload: All image files (001.jpg, 002.jpg, etc.)

### Step 3: Configure (if needed)
- Ensure `.htaccess` file exists for proper routing (see below)
- Make sure file permissions are set correctly (644 for files, 755 for folders)

### .htaccess Configuration
Create a `.htaccess` file in your public_html directory with:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
  RewriteEngine On
  RewriteBase /
  RewriteRule ^index\.html$ - [L]
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
  RewriteRule . /index.html [L]
</IfModule>
```

### Step 4: Verify
Visit your domain and test all pages and functionality.
